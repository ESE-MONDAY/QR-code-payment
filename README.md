# QR Code Payment with Smart Contracts

When working with a smart contract, the URL or data encoded in the QR code will likely need to include information specific to the smart contract interaction. This could include the contract address, the method to call, and any parameters required by the method.

For example, if you are working with an Ethereum smart contract, you might want to generate a QR code that encodes an Ethereum transaction. This could include the contract address, the method to call, and the amount to send.

Here's an example of how you might modify the generateQRCode function to generate a QR code for an Ethereum transaction:

Smart Contract Address: The address of the smart contract.
Method to Call: The method you want to call on the smart contract.
Parameters: Any parameters required by the method.
Assuming you have a smart contract with an address 0xYourContractAddress and a method pay that takes an amount parameter, you might generate a QR code like this:

```jsx
const generateQRCode = () => {
  const contractAddress = '0xYourContractAddress';
  const method = 'pay';
  const qrData = `ethereum:${contractAddress}/function:${method}?amount=${amount}`;
  setQrValue(qrData);
};
```
